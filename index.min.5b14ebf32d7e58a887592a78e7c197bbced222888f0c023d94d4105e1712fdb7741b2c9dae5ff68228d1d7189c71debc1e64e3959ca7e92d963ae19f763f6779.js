We may possibly help in finding a nice way to begin.\nJoin our dev and study groups #\rScicloj is organizing a few dev groups and study groups that meet regularly to learn, to brainstorm, and to create. Your perspective could be helpful there.\nShare your experience #\rHearing about your personal workflow, data stories, problems and ideas can be valuable to others. Just open a new topic at one of the other relevant chat streams, and share your thoughts.\nWrite a tutorial #\rWriting tutorials (either small or big) about working with data is central to our process. The importance is twofold: sharing realistic experiences, and realizing what may be missing or could be improved in our stack. You may just pick an existing tutorial and translate it to Clojure. Or, you can pick some fresh new data and start analysing them from scratch.\nJoin the organizing team #\rAre you interested in the human aspects of growing the community? Or, do you want to be involved in the thought process about the goals and priorities of this community? Then the scicloj organizing team would welcome you to join. Even if your time is limited, contributing your thought can be important.\nPair with a library author #\rLibrary authors need users. Some of the actively developed libraries would benefit a lot from a user trying to use them and sharing their findings.\nHelp building the website and knowledge base #\rThe scicloj website would love to have more people involved in it. Contributing to the content organization, writing opinionated blog posts, helping with the aesthetics \u0026ndash; all would be welcome.\nCreate some proof of concept #\rDo you think that something is missing in our stack? Then let us maybe create it! Beginning with a small proof of concept, you can test the idea with other community members. If you suggest your idea, maybe someone will be happy to join you, and you create it together.\nContribute to a library #\rIs there any library that you are curious to learn about or just want to help building? Then a good way to learn may be to contribute. This may be some help in adding a feature, adding some tests, or writing documentation. You can offer that to the library author. Some would be happy and might offer a nice way to begin.\nSubmit an issue #\rHave you found a bug or a missing feature? Probably, the maintainers of actively developed libraries would be happy to know about it. Usually, the project Issues page or the project Zulip stream would be the place to do that.

Emacs is wonderful, but it is not required for learning Clojure. Please reach out for help you wish to learn the book with another environment.\n📖 [R4DS] R for Data Science by Wickham and Grolemund\nThis is a good intro to the R language and its use in basic data-science tasks. It uses the Tidyverse collection of R packages and the so-called \u0026ldquo;tidy\u0026rdquo; approach, which is common in today\u0026rsquo;s R community.\nWe will use parts of it a basic intro to R. Knowing some R would make participants more independent in approaching study resources on their own. Python could have been another option, but we prefer R, since its ecosystem is arguably more in harmony with the functional approach and with expressing statistical ideas.\n📖 [Clj4DS] Clojure for Data Science by Henry Garner\nThis is an excellent intro to data science topics, but it uses Clojure libraries which are not actively developed anymore.\nIt will be used for a few of the case studies, that we will adapt to this course.\n"}).add({id:8,href:"/docs/community/groups/data-recur/",title:"data-recur: recurring updates \u0026 discussions around building the emerging data stack",description:"recurring updates \u0026 discussions around building the emerging data stack",content:"The goal of this group is to create collaborations in building the emerging Clojure stack of libraries for data processing, analysis, and visualization.\n Meeting 1 - the beginning (end of July 2022) - to be announted soon  Organizer: Daniel Slutsky (please reach out at the Clojurians Zulip)\nFrequency of meetings: All-hands monthlu meetings + ad-hoc meetings on specific topics\nChat stream: #data-recur\n"}).add({id:9,href:"/docs/community/groups/jointprob/",title:"jointprob: a probabilistic modelling and Bayesian statistics study group",description:"Probabilistic Modelling and Bayesian Statistics study group",content:" \r\rThis page describes the plans for a new online study group planned to start in Fall 2022, around the topics of probabilistic modelling and Bayesian computing.\nEven though the group is initiated by Scicloj \u0026ndash; a community for data science in Clojure \u0026ndash; this study group will not be focused on any single technology or programming language. Rather, it will be open to people of diverse technical backgrounds, and will continually seek dialogue and mutual inspiration across languages and technologies.\nThe details below are tentative.\nAgenda #\rWe will begin by learning one introductory book. It will probably be Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath.\nThen, we will proceed with more advanced books and articles.\nBayesian statistics is tightly related to programming, and during our learning we will look into different programming languages and libraries.\nIn parallel to the main path of learning, we will encourage individual and small-group projects, and will share our progress with each other.\nSessions #\rWe will meet once in two weeks to learn together for two hours. The first hour will be dedicated to following our main path of study (e.g., the current book chapter being read). In the second hour, we will share our progress with the projects, and explore further.\nIn between these main sessions, we will encourage ad-hoc sessions to explore specialized topics or practice further.\nRecordings #\rSome parts of the sessions will be recorded and shared with the group. Some parts will also be made public.\nProjects #\rParticipants will take on projects as individuals or in small groups.\nExample projects:\n read an article and share it with the group reimplement an example we\u0026rsquo;ve learned using a different technology explore a dataset with the methods learned  Assumed background #\rWe will probably assume some background in programming, math, and statistics. This will be made more precise soon.\nPrinciples #\rThe following core principles are typical to Scicloj study groups.\nNo experts. We do not assume that anybody in the group is an expert in the field. We come to learn together with a student mindset.\nA clear path. We will be very thoughtful about the agenda and about where we wish to go. We will continuously rethink and adapt our path going there.\nConfused together. It is just fine to be confused. We will be there together and seek clarity together.\nBeing active. The group encourages its members to learn independently and take on projects. In a sense, its purpose is (also) to support those individual journeys.\nMutual curiosity. We make serious efforts to be inclusive to participants of various backgrounds. The different perspectives of our friends are part of what we wish to learn.\nContact #\rIf you are interested, please reach out to us.\n"}).add({id:10,href:"/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/",title:"{renamed} probabilistic modelling study group",description:"{renamed} probabilistic modelling study group",content:" This group has been renamed as jointprob.\n"}).add({id:11,href:"/docs/community/groups/",title:"Dev \u0026 study groups",description:"The various dev groups and study groups organized by Scicloj",content:"Some parts of the Scicloj activity are driven by regular meetings in various groups.\n"}).add({id:12,href:"/docs/community/groups/visual-tools/",title:"visual-tools: regular updates \u0026 discussionsd around building visual tooling",description:"The visual-tools group",content:"The goal of this group is to create collaborations in learning and building Clojure tools for data visualization and literate programming.\nThe authors of several actively developed tools are involved (Chlorine, Clover, Calva, Portal, Viscous, Sidebar, Nette, Fabricate, Omni-trace, Oz, Saite, Notespace, Clay, Goldly, Saturn, clt-tiles, Obsidian Wielder, Cardigan Bay, Platypub, etc.).\n Meeting 1 - the beginning (Feb. 4th 2022) - summary \u0026amp; video.

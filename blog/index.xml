The meetings back then did affect our actions and followup conversations at the Clojurians Zulip Chat. A broader and more general process initiated: shifting our attention to the growth of Clojure into new fields and use cases.</description></item><item><title>Data analyis with Clojure - free workshop, May 10th - initial survey</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/data-analyis-with-clojure-free-workshop-may-10th-initial-survey/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/data-analyis-with-clojure-free-workshop-may-10th-initial-survey/</guid><description>Following the maturing of the Noj toolkit for Clojure data science, we are planning a free online workshop for people who are curious to learn the Clojure language for data analysis. Please share this page broadly with your friends and groups who may be curious to learn Clojure at this occasion.
The SciNoj Light conference schedule is emerging these days, with a fantastic set of talks. We want a broader audience to feel comfortable joining, and thus we wish to run a prep workshop one week earlier.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - November 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-november-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-november-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organization has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q3 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky. This is the second time the project has been selected this year. Here is Daniel&amp;rsquo;s last update for this period.

Clojurists Together update - November 2024 - Daniel Slutsky #
Scicloj is a Clojure group developing a stack of tools and libraries for data science.</description></item><item><title>Scicloj scientific papers - initial planning meeting</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/scicloj-scientific-papers-initial-planning-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/scicloj-scientific-papers-initial-planning-meeting/</guid><description>Now that the Clojure stack for scientific computing is maturing rapidly, the Scicloj group is looking at ways of reaching other communities.
One avenue would be to consider publishing academic papers about the ecosystem: regarding individual libraries or outlining the ecosystem as a whole. Another avenue, is that the Scicloj group would like to encourage and help out with research projects themselves.
In the second half of November, we will have an initial planning meeting to discuss possible challenges and opportunities.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - October 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-october-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-october-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organisation has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q3 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky.

The New Column API #
Today we at scicloj deployed a new Column API (tablecloth.column.api) into the data processing library Tablecloth (available as of version 7.029.1). This new API adds a new primitive to the Tablecloth system: the column. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we use it:</description></item><item><title>The Current State of ML in Clojure</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/the-current-state-of-ml-in-clojure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/the-current-state-of-ml-in-clojure/</guid><description>This is a cross-post of a recent post by Kira McLean at her blog, that has encouraged a few discussions over the web.
Recently, a few of us at Scicloj have had enlightening discussions of of current state of the machine learning landscape in Clojure. This post is my attempt to distill it into a summary for the community&amp;rsquo;s benefit, so more people can understand where things are at and what the active developers in this space are working on.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - March 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-march-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-march-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organisation has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q1 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky.

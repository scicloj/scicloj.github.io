One avenue would be to consider publishing academic papers about the ecosystem: regarding individual libraries or outlining the ecosystem as a whole. Another avenue, is that the Scicloj group would like to encourage and help out with research projects themselves.
In the second half of November, we will have an initial planning meeting to discuss possible challenges and opportunities.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - October 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-october-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-october-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organisation has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q3 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky.

The New Column API #
Today we at scicloj deployed a new Column API (tablecloth.column.api) into the data processing library Tablecloth (available as of version 7.029.1). This new API adds a new primitive to the Tablecloth system: the column. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we use it:</description></item><item><title>The Current State of ML in Clojure</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/the-current-state-of-ml-in-clojure/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/the-current-state-of-ml-in-clojure/</guid><description>This is a cross-post of a recent post by Kira McLean at her blog, that has encouraged a few discussions over the web.
Recently, a few of us at Scicloj have had enlightening discussions of of current state of the machine learning landscape in Clojure. This post is my attempt to distill it into a summary for the community&amp;rsquo;s benefit, so more people can understand where things are at and what the active developers in this space are working on.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - March 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-march-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-march-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organisation has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q1 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky.

This series was inpired by a few other projects in the Clojure community, such as Rupert&amp;rsquo;s initiative to work on models that may work well with Clojure language tasks, the related #clojurellm channel that was created by John Newman and Rupert, and the various libraries for LLMs and related services, that have been keep emerging mostly during 2023.</description></item><item><title>Jointprob community updates - Probability Basics talk, Hierarchical Models followup</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/jointprob-community-updates-probability-basics-talk-hierarchical-models-followup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/jointprob-community-updates-probability-basics-talk-hierarchical-models-followup/</guid><description>⭐ TL;DR: See you at the September standalone talk of the Jointprob &amp;ndash; an intro to Probability basics.

Background #
The Jointprob community was created by Scicloj during the summer of 2022, aspiring to be a space where friends of diverse backgrounds can learn &amp;amp; explore Bayesian statistics and probabilistic modeling.</description></item></channel></rss>

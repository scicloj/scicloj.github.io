We may possibly help in finding a nice way to begin.\nJoin our dev and study groups #\rScicloj is organizing a few dev groups and study groups that meet regularly to learn, to brainstorm, and to create. Your perspective could be helpful there.\nShare your experience #\rHearing about your personal workflow, data stories, problems and ideas can be valuable to others. Just open a new topic at one of the other relevant chat streams, and share your thoughts.\nWrite a tutorial #\rWriting tutorials (either small or big) about working with data is central to our process. The importance is twofold: sharing realistic experiences, and realizing what may be missing or could be improved in our stack. You may just pick an existing tutorial and translate it to Clojure. Or, you can pick some fresh new data and start analysing them from scratch.\nJoin the organizing team #\rAre you interested in the human aspects of growing the community? Or, do you want to be involved in the thought process about the goals and priorities of this community? Then the scicloj organizing team would welcome you to join. Even if your time is limited, contributing your thought can be important.\nPair with a library author #\rLibrary authors need users. Some of the actively developed libraries would benefit a lot from a user trying to use them and sharing their findings.\nHelp building the website and knowledge base #\rThe scicloj website would love to have more people involved in it. Contributing to the content organization, writing opinionated blog posts, helping with the aesthetics \u0026ndash; all would be welcome.\nCreate some proof of concept #\rDo you think that something is missing in our stack? Then let us maybe create it! Beginning with a small proof of concept, you can test the idea with other community members. If you suggest your idea, maybe someone will be happy to join you, and you create it together.\nContribute to a library #\rIs there any library that you are curious to learn about or just want to help building? Then a good way to learn may be to contribute. This may be some help in adding a feature, adding some tests, or writing documentation. You can offer that to the library author. Some would be happy and might offer a nice way to begin.\nSubmit an issue #\rHave you found a bug or a missing feature? Probably, the maintainers of actively developed libraries would be happy to know about it. Usually, the project Issues page or the project Zulip stream would be the place to do that.

Emacs is wonderful, but it is not required for learning Clojure. Please reach out for help you wish to learn the book with another environment.\n📖 [R4DS] R for Data Science by Wickham and Grolemund\nThis is a good intro to the R language and its use in basic data-science tasks. It uses the Tidyverse collection of R packages and the so-called \u0026ldquo;tidy\u0026rdquo; approach, which is common in today\u0026rsquo;s R community.\nWe will use parts of it a basic intro to R. Knowing some R would make participants more independent in approaching study resources on their own. Python could have been another option, but we prefer R, since its ecosystem is arguably more in harmony with the functional approach and with expressing statistical ideas.\n📖 [Clj4DS] [Clojure for Data Science](https://www.packtpub.com/product/clojure-for-data-science/9781784397180** by Henry Garner\nThis is an excellent intro to data science topics, but it uses Clojure libraries which are not actively developed anymore.\nIt will be used for a few of the case studies, that we will adapt to this course.\nlist of topics (tentative) #\rlanguage #\r(mostly self learning)\n Clojure R  from today\u0026rsquo;s brainstorming:\ntheory \u0026amp; methods #\r(very basic intros)\n hello world: a typical workflow reshaping data (the \u0026ldquo;tidy\u0026rdquo; notion) correctness: testing, reproducibility descriptive statistics frequentist statistical inference supervised learning: principles \u0026amp; workflow, regression, classification working with tree-structured data probabilistic modelling through Bayesian statistics unsuprevised learning: clustering, dimension reduction linear algebra deep networks nlp async data streams graph data  libraries \u0026amp; tools #\r(some introduced briefly, some more thoroughly)\n tables: tablecloth, tech.ml.dataset arrays: dtype-next transducers: xforms, injest correctness (schemas): malli data vis \u0026amp; notebook tooling: portal, oz, clerk, clay data vis grammars: hanami, cljplot?

Probably, it will be a new reading journy with a new choice of book.\nGoal #\rThis is a long-term project aiming to create a space for Bayesian practitioners, as well as aspiring ones, to learn \u0026amp; explore together and support each other.\nWe wish to be inclusive to people of diverse backgrounds and thus create a common ground where we can broaden our perspectives and inspire each other.\nJoining #\rIt is never too late to join us \u0026ndash; we will help you to catch up.\nPlease use the Joining Jointprob form to join the community, to be added to our calendar events, or to update your preferences and personal information.\nAlso, you are always invited to write to us.\nSchedule #\rOur current journey: standalone sessions #\r 2023-08-16/26: Hierarchical Models with David MacGillivray - blog post - 🎥 video 🎥 2023-09-20/30: Probability basics for Bayesian analysis - blog post - recording will be shared soon  Our second reading journey: Bayesian Modeling and Computation #\r 2023-01-07: Bayesian Modeling and Computation: meeting the book\u0026rsquo;s author Ravin Kumar and brainstorming our new reading journey \u0026ndash; see the blog post. 2023-01-21: Discussing our reading plans 2023-02-8/11: a motivating intro \u0026ndash; Bayesian Methods for Hackers chapter 1 2023-02-15/18: probability \u0026amp; statistics review \u0026ndash; Think Stats 2e chapters 1-6 2023-02-22/25: starting the main journey \u0026ndash; Bayesian Modeling and Computation chapter 1 (mostly focused on section 1.1) 2023-03-8/11: Bayesian Modeling and Computation chapter 1: exercises and section 1.4 (priors) 2023-03-22/25: Bayesian Modeling and Computation chapter 2 2023-04-05/08: Bayesian Modeling and Computation chapter 2, mostly section 2.5 2023-04-19/22: Bayesian Modeling and Computation chapter 3 2023-05-3/6: Bayesian Modeling and Computation chapter 3, starting from section 3.3 2023-05-17/20: Bayesian Modeling and Computation chapter 4 2023-05-31/06-03: Tensorflow Probability 2023-06-14/17: selected dopics from chapters 5,6,7 of Bayesian Modeling and Computation 2023-06-28/07-01: chapter 8 of Bayesian Modeling and Computation 2023-07-12/15: chapter 9 of Bayesian Modeling and Computation  Our first reading journey: Statistical Rethinking #\r 2022-07-22, initial brainstorming - event 2022-08-06, prep meeting about R \u0026amp; Tidyverse - event (joint event with the ds4clj course) 2022-08-15 - beginning of regular meetings (see the Groups below). 2022-08-15/17/19/20, Session 1: Statistical Rethinking chapter 1, R4DS sections 1-4 2022-08-31, 2022-09-2/3, Session 2: Statistical Rethinking chapter 2 2022-09-14/16/17, Session 3: chapter 2 - review of main notions and a look into exercises 2022-09-28/09-30/10-01, Session 4: chapter 3 2022-10-12/14/15, Session 5: chapter 4 2022-10-26/28/29, Session 6: chapter 4 - continued 2022-11-9/11/12, Session 7: chapter 5 2022-11-23/25/26, Session 8: chapter 6, personal regression projects 2022-12-7/9/10, Session 9: more about DAGs (section 6.4), chapter 7 2022-12-24, Session 10: information theory \u0026amp; information criteria - reporting on personal reading  Past Agenda #\rIn the past, we have been meeting biweekly (in groups) to discuss our joint reading and projects.\nOur joint reading journeys have been around the first half of Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath, and then around Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python by Osvaldo A. Martin, Ravin Kumar and Junpeng Lao.\n Present Agenda #\rCurrently, we meet about once a month around standalone talks of various topics. We also encourage individual and small-group projects, that participants share and present in the sessions.\nCalendar events #\rPlease refer to the Joining section to join our calendar events.\nChat #\rThe community uses Zulip, an open-source chat platform. In some other groups we\u0026rsquo;ve been running, we\u0026rsquo;ve found it useful for chat, in-depth discussion threads, and knowledge management.\nOur Zulip organization is jointprob.zulipchat.com.\nYou may wish to learn a little bit about the concepts of Zulip streams and topics. Note that all streams and topics (and even single messages) have URLs, that you can open at separate tabs in your browser.\nIt would be wonderful to present yourself at the personal intros stream, preferably as a new topic thread.\nVideo platform #\rFor video meetings, we currently use Zoom. The link is shared in the calendar events.\nRecordings #\rSome parts of the sessions are recorded and shared internally in the Zulip chat. Possibly, we will also share some recorded parts publicly.\nProjects #\rParticipants take on projects as individuals or in small groups.\nExample projects:\n read an article and share it with the group reimplement an example we have learned using a different technology explore a dataset with the methods learned  Recommended background #\rParticipants are assumed to have some relevant knowledge.\nTo appreciate the content we are studying, it is recommended to have the following:\n basic knowledge of probability and statistics (say, college-level intro courses) programming experience in any language (a few months) experience exploring data an open mind  If you are not sure whether this journey fits your background, please write to us. We can think together.\nPrinciples #\rThe following core principles are typical of Scicloj study groups.\nNo experts. We do not assume that anybody is an expert in the field. We come to learn together with a student mindset.\nA clear path. We will be very thoughtful about the agenda and where we wish to go. We will continually rethink and adapt our pathway going there.\nConfused together. It is just fine to be confused. We will be there together and seek clarity together.\nBeing active. We encourage members to learn independently and take on projects. In a sense, its purpose is (also) to support those individual journeys.\nMutual curiosity. We make serious efforts to be inclusive to participants of various backgrounds. The different perspectives of our friends are part of what we wish to learn.\nContact #\rPlease reach out:\n scicloj@gmail.com Daniel Slutsky at the chat  "}).add({id:14,href:"/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/",title:"{renamed} probabilistic modelling study group",description:"{renamed} probabilistic modelling study group",content:" This group has been renamed as jointprob.\n"}).add({id:15,href:"/docs/community/groups/",title:"Dev \u0026 study groups",description:"The various dev groups and study groups organized by Scicloj",content:"Some parts of the Scicloj activity are driven by regular meetings in various groups.\nSome of these meetings are public and shared at the Clojure calendar feed.

We will think together about whether this group fits your path.\nSessions #\rAs a group, we will have biweekly sessions to discuss our ongoing projects. Participants will bring their own data \u0026amp; science problems to the sessions and actively work on them between sessions.\nSome of the time will be dedicated to learning relevant practices, ideas, and technical topics.\nWe will also have one-on-one or small-group sessions to support individual journeys.\nRecordings #\rThe sessions will be partially recorded.\nMost of the recordings will not be shared publicly but rather internally as a tool for us to catch up and recall our past discussions. When recordings are planned to be made public, we will first check with all participants.\nPairing #\rIn the group, we will seek opportunities of collaborations.\nA scientist may wish to pair with a Clojure engineer and explore something together, a Clojurian person may be curious about joining a scientific project, etc. We will be looking for such cases and try to help in matching them.\nContributing #\rIn your projects using the emerging Clojure stack, there will often be opportunities to contribute back to the libraries you use. We will encourage that and help you in considering about fruitful directions and connecting with the relevant library authors.\nWe will highly encourage contributing documentation and tutorials and will use the Clojure Data Scrapbook as a central space for such content.\nChat #\rThe group will use the Clojurians Zulip chat.

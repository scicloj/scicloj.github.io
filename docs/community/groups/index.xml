For various reasons of community priorities, this project was delayed. As of May 2024, we are reconsidering a revised version, which is probably a semi-structured series of talks alongside the more hands-on real-world-data group.
The content below is the old 2022-2023 draft.

What is that? #
One of the big challenges of getting involved in open source is gaining a sense of relevance: are the features you are working on actually valuable? That is one of the main benefits of collaborating with open-source groups such as Scicloj.
Scicloj offers a clear path to getting involved in open-source tools and libraries, both new and established.</description></item><item><title>{coming soon} a dev group about interop and transpilers</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/interop/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/interop/</guid><description>coming soon
In this group, we wish to explore projects such as ClojisR&amp;rsquo;s code generation, a similar layer we have at Wolframite, and general transpilers such as Kalai and Std.lang.
We hope to find some common ground and principles across these projects.
As of May 2024, we are not organizing this group yet, but hopefully it will begin later during this year.</description></item><item><title>data-recur: recurring updates &amp; discussions around building the emerging data stack</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/data-recur/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/data-recur/</guid><description>This group is a space for recurring updates &amp;amp; discussions around the emerging Clojure stack for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

The goal of this series of meetups is to support our learning, as a community, of the new landscape of ideas around large language models.
Some of the content here is specific to the Clojure ecosystem (e.g., discussing the use of LLMs from Clojure), but many parts of it could be helpful and interesting to broader audiences.

Even though the community was initiated by Scicloj &amp;ndash; a community for data science in Clojure &amp;ndash; this study community is not focused on any single technology or programming language. Rather, it is open to people of diverse technical backgrounds and will continually seek dialogue and mutual inspiration across languages and technologies.</description></item><item><title>{renamed} probabilistic modelling study group</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/</guid><description>This group has been renamed as jointprob.</description></item><item><title>real-world-data: a space to discuss your data and science projects in Clojure</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/</guid><description>The real-world-data group is about the use of Clojure for data and science problems.

The goal of this group is to create collaborations in learning and building Clojure tools data visualization, literate programming, and UI design.
The authors of several actively developed tools have been involved in offering talks and collaborating in this space (Chlorine, Clover, Calva and its Notebooks, Portal, Viscous, Sidebar, Nette, Fabricate, Omni-trace, Oz, Saite, Notespace, Clay, Claykind, Goldly, Saturn, clt-tiles, Obsidian Wielder, Cardigan Bay, Platypub, Data Rabbit, Clerk, Mosaic, MetaREPL, Meyvn, badspreadsheet, Noj, ggclj, Space-Age, etc.</description></item><item><title>{on hold} ml-study: practicing the use of the emerging stack</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/ml-study/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/ml-study/</guid><description>(this group is on hold)
The ml-study group has been a space for regular meetings for practicing the usage of the emerging Clojure data science stack.
It has been serving us not only in learning, but also in testing the emerging stack and creating a collection of usage examples.
Organizer: Daniel Slutsky (please reach out at the Clojurians Zulip)

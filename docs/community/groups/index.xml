For various reasons of community priorities, this project was delayed. As of May 2024, we are reconsidering a revised version, which is probably a semi-structured series of talks alongside the more hands-on real-world-data group.
The content below is the old 2022-2023 draft.

Growing Clojure together

Background #
For the past few years, Scicloj has focused inward - building tools and libraries while growing our community through our mentoring program and other small group meetings.
Now in 2025, we are also looking outward, seeking to bring Clojure to new fields and users.</description></item><item><title>scicloj-ai-meetups: exploring the princples and uses of AI models</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/ai-meetups/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/ai-meetups/</guid><description>ðŸ“…Follow our meetings on the Clojure Calendar FeedðŸ“…
The goal of this group is to support our learning and research, as a community, of the landscape of ideas around AI models. It continues the journey of the scicloj-llm-meetups group and broandens the scope to various AI models, their principles, and applications. Some of the content here is specific to the Clojure ecosystem, but many parts of it will be helpful and interesting to broader audiences.</description></item><item><title>SciNoj Light: an online conference for Clojure data-analysis stories</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/scinoj-light/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/scinoj-light/</guid><description>The SciNoj Light conference series is a space for collaboration on making Clojure more present, well-known, and accessible in diverse domains and uses cases.

What is that? #
One of the big challenges of getting involved in open source is gaining a sense of relevance: are the features you are working on actually valuable? That is one of the main benefits of collaborating with open-source groups such as Scicloj.
Scicloj offers a clear path to getting involved in open-source tools and libraries, both new and established.</description></item><item><title>{on hold} a dev group about interop and transpilers</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/interop/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/interop/</guid><description>coming soon
In this group, we wish to explore projects such as ClojisR&amp;rsquo;s code generation, a similar layer we have at Wolframite, and general transpilers such as Kalai and Std.lang.
We hope to find some common ground and principles across these projects.
As of May 2024, we are not organizing this group yet, but hopefully it will begin later during this year.</description></item><item><title>data-recur: recurring updates &amp; discussions around building the emerging data stack</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/data-recur/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/data-recur/</guid><description>This group is a space for recurring updates &amp;amp; discussions around the emerging Clojure stack for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

The goal of this series of meetups is to support our learning, as a community, of the new landscape of ideas around large language models.
Some of the content here is specific to the Clojure ecosystem (e.g., discussing the use of LLMs from Clojure), but many parts of it could be helpful and interesting to broader audiences.</description></item><item><title>{on hold} Jointprob: a probabilistic modeling and Bayesian statistics study community</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/jointprob/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/jointprob/</guid><description>Jointprob is a study community for probabilistic modeling and Bayesian statistics, running since August 2022.
Even though the community was initiated by Scicloj &amp;ndash; a community for data science in Clojure &amp;ndash; this study community is not focused on any single technology or programming language. Rather, it is open to people of diverse technical backgrounds and will continually seek dialogue and mutual inspiration across languages and technologies.</description></item><item><title>{renamed} probabilistic modelling study group</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/</guid><description>This group has been renamed as jointprob.</description></item></channel></rss>

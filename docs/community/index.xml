Scicloj is an open source group and community building project. It focuses on helping Clojure grow into new fields, use cases, and professions.
While it began with a narrow focus on data science and scientific computing, throughout the years, it expanded its scope to the broader problem of Clojure growth.
There are various places where activities move forward (for more info check the Where section), and they are all open to discussion and contribution.</description></item><item><title>Getting Involved</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/getting_involved/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/getting_involved/</guid><description>Want to help make Clojure a vibrant platform for data science?

Most of our communication takes place in specific streams (also called channels) at the Clojurians Zulip chat.
Small task groups often create ad-hoc streams for their task, but a lot of the communitcation takes place in more popular, long-living streams (examples below).
Most streams are public, some are private. Usually, streams are chosen to be private not for secrecy, but for focus, and for creating an atmosphere where people are comfortable talking, knowing who are listening.</description></item><item><title>Events</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/events/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/events/</guid><description>Our public events are shared at the Clojure calendar feed by @eval and at the various Clojure social platforms.

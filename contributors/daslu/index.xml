The meetings back then did affect our actions and followup conversations at the Clojurians Zulip Chat. A broader and more general process has been initiated: shifting our attention to growth &amp;ndash; the growth of Clojure into new fields and use cases.</description></item><item><title>Data analyis with Clojure - free workshop, May 10th - initial survey</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/data-analyis-with-clojure-free-workshop-may-10th-initial-survey/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/data-analyis-with-clojure-free-workshop-may-10th-initial-survey/</guid><description>Following the maturing of the Noj toolkit for Clojure data science, we are planning a free online workshop for people who are curious to learn the Clojure language for data analysis. Please share this page broadly with your friends and groups who may be curious to learn Clojure at this occasion.
The SciNoj Light conference schedule is emerging these days, with a fantastic set of talks. We want a broader audience to feel comfortable joining, and thus we wish to run a prep workshop one week earlier.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - November 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-november-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-november-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organization has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q3 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky.

Clojurists Together update - November 2024 - Daniel Slutsky #
Scicloj is a Clojure group developing a stack of tools and libraries for data science.</description></item><item><title>Scicloj scientific papers - initial planning meeting</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/scicloj-scientific-papers-initial-planning-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/scicloj-scientific-papers-initial-planning-meeting/</guid><description>Now that the Clojure stack for scientific computing is maturing rapidly, the Scicloj group is looking at ways of reaching other communities.
One avenue would be to consider publishing academic papers about the ecosystem: regarding individual libraries or outlining the ecosystem as a whole. Another avenue, is that the Scicloj group would like to encourage and help out with research projects themselves.
In the second half of November, we will have an initial planning meeting to discuss possible challenges and opportunities.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - October 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-october-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-october-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organisation has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q3 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky.

This series was inpired by a few other projects in the Clojure community, such as Rupert&amp;rsquo;s initiative to work on models that may work well with Clojure language tasks, the related #clojurellm channel that was created by John Newman and Rupert, and the various libraries for LLMs and related services, that have been keep emerging mostly during 2023.</description></item></channel></rss>

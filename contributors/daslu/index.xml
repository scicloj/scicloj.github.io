Recently, Kira Howe gave a great workshop about Clojure and Noj at the BobKonf 2025 conference. Following that successful experience, we will now organize a longer workshop that will teach Clojure and Noj for data analysis from scratch.
The SciNoj Light conference schedule is emerging these days, with a fantastic set of talks.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - November 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-november-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-november-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organization has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q3 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky. This is the second time the project has been selected this year. Here is Daniel&amp;rsquo;s last update for this period.
This overview of November&amp;rsquo;s work is extended by a few recent updates from the first half of December.

Clojurists Together update - November 2024 - Daniel Slutsky #
Scicloj is a Clojure group developing a stack of tools and libraries for data science.</description></item><item><title>Scicloj scientific papers - initial planning meeting</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/scicloj-scientific-papers-initial-planning-meeting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/scicloj-scientific-papers-initial-planning-meeting/</guid><description>Now that the Clojure stack for scientific computing is maturing rapidly, the Scicloj group is looking at ways of reaching other communities.
One avenue would be to consider publishing academic papers about the ecosystem: regarding individual libraries or outlining the ecosystem as a whole. Another avenue, is that the Scicloj group would like to encourage and help out with research projects themselves.
In the second half of November, we will have an initial planning meeting to discuss possible challenges and opportunities.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - October 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-october-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-october-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organisation has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q3 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky.

This series was inpired by a few other projects in the Clojure community, such as Rupert&amp;rsquo;s initiative to work on models that may work well with Clojure language tasks, the related #clojurellm channel that was created by John Newman and Rupert, and the various libraries for LLMs and related services, that have been keep emerging mostly during 2023.</description></item><item><title>About Scicloj</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/about/</guid><description>What #
Scicloj is an open, free and dynamic hub for building a Clojure ecosystem for data science, scientific computing and data engineering.
In short, it is for anyone who is interested in using Clojure to work with data.
There are various places where activities move forward (for more info check the Where section), and they are all open to discussion and contribution.
Who #
We are Clojurians coming from very different backgrounds and with very different levels of knowledge around Clojure and data science who share a common goal: making Clojure and data science better by combining them.</description></item></channel></rss>

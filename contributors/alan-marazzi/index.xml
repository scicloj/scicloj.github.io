Scicloj is an open source group and community building project. It focuses on helping Clojure grow into new fields, use cases, and professions.
While it began with a narrow focus on data science and scientific computing, throughout the years, it expanded its scope to the broader problem of Clojure growth.
There are various places where activities move forward (for more info check the Where section), and they are all open to discussion and contribution.</description></item></channel></rss>

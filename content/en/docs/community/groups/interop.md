In this group, we wish to explore projects such as [ClojisR's code generation](https://scicloj.github.io/clojisr/clojisr.v1.tutorials.codegen.html), a similar layer we have at [Wolframite](https://github.com/scicloj/wolframite/), and general transpilers such as [Kalai](https://github.com/kalai-transpiler/kalai) and [Std.lang](https://github.com/zcaudate/foundation-base?tab=readme-ov-file#stdlang---a-playground-for-languages).

We hope to find some common ground and principles across these projects.

As of May 2024, we are not organizing this group yet, but hopefully it will begin later during this year.

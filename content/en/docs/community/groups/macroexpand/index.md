# macroexpand meetups

Opening Clojure up to new horizons

## TL;DR
We are organizing a series of online meetups/mini-conferences to help coordinate new efforts towards Clojure's expansion.

## Background

In the recent couple of years, a lot of Scicloj activity has been directed inwards -- working on infrastructure, tools, and libraries, building the group, and helping each other in hundreds of small meetings, mostly invisible, through out [mentoring program](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/open-source-mentoring/) and elsewhere.

While all this will continue, in 2025, we are looking outwards more than before. We are intentionally looking to bring Clojure to new scenes, use cases, and communities, where it has not been so present in the past. Quite a few of us have been putting a lot of care into crafting new [beginner-friendly tooling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDz1x2d65C0), [workshops](https://bobkonf.de/2025/howe.html) for people who are new to Clojure, many more public [meetings](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/events/) at the [various study groups](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/), various [tutorials](https://scicloj.github.io/clojure-data-tutorials/), a quick-start [toolkit](https://scicloj.github.io/noj/), and a beginner-friendly [a conference](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/scinoj-light/) dedicated to new data use cases.

While Scicloj is a group focusing on data and science, Clojure's growth in the broader sense is aligned with our interests and efforts. To support that process, we will need to look and reflect inwards and outwards at the same time.

Thus, we are beginning *macroexpand* - a series of meetups where Clojurians will discuss and initiate collaborations around Clojure growth.

## Format

Each macroexpand meetup will have a theme - a certain landscape where we wish to make Clojure more present. Education, research, academia, community building, and art are some examples. Intentionally, they ovelap.

The meeting length will vary between 90 minutes to a few hours, depending on availability and participation.

We will mix short presentations with discussions. Only some parts will be recorded. We will seek actionable conclusions whe can follow-up on.

Everything will be lightweight and easy to organize and participate in. We want people to conveniently join, tell the stories and seek collaboration.

## Participation

To join the meetings, you can mark your availability and interests in the following poll. You can do it anytime. Based on the polls, we will continually schedule meetups.

You do not need to know much Clojure to participate. We do assume that you are interested in active collaboration on Clojure growth.

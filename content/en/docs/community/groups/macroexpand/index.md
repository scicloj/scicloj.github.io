# macroexpand gatherings

Building new pathways for Clojure's growth

## TL;DR
We're launching a series of online meetups and mini-conferences to coordinate efforts for expanding Clojure's reach and adoption.

## Background

Over the past couple of years, Scicloj has focused inward - developing infrastructure, tools, and libraries while nurturing our community through numerous small meetings via our [mentoring program](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/open-source-mentoring/) and other initiatives.

As we enter 2025, we're expanding our focus outward. We aim to introduce Clojure to new domains, use cases, and communities where it hasn't yet gained significant traction. Our community members have invested considerable effort in creating [beginner-friendly tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDz1x2d65C0), developing [workshops](https://bobkonf.de/2025/howe.html) for Clojure newcomers, organizing public [meetings](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/events/) across [various study groups](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/), crafting [tutorials](https://scicloj.github.io/clojure-data-tutorials/), building a quick-start [toolkit](https://scicloj.github.io/noj/), and launching [a conference](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/scinoj-light/) focused on new data applications.

While Scicloj primarily focuses on data science, we recognize that Clojure's overall growth aligns with our mission. To support this expansion, we need to maintain both an internal and external perspective.

This is why we're launching *macroexpand* - a series of gatherings where Clojurians can discuss and collaborate on initiatives for Clojure's growth.

## Format

Each macroexpand gathering will focus on a specific theme where we aim to increase Clojure's presence. Themes may include education, research, academia, community building, and artistic applications, with natural overlap between areas.

Gatherings will run from 90 minutes to several hours. They will combine short presentations with open discussions. Select parts will be recorded, and we'll focus on developing actionable outcomes for follow-up.

We're keeping the format lightweight and accessible to make it easy for people to join, share their experiences, and find collaborators.

## Participation

To join upcoming gatherings, please indicate your availability and interests in the poll below. You can respond at any time.

You don't need to be a Clojure expert to participate - we welcome anyone interested in actively contributing to Clojure's growth.

The goal of this study group is to learn signal processing together by implementing concepts from the book [**Think DSP**](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-dsp/) by Allen B. Downey in Clojure. This hands-on approach allows us to learn digital signal processing fundamentals while exploring how Clojure's features can be applied to numerical and scientific computing.

## Meetings

Meetings typically last 120 minutes and are announced on [ClojureVerse](https://clojureverse.org/).

## About Think DSP

[Think DSP](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-dsp/) is an introduction to Digital Signal Processing in Python. We'll be translating the concepts and exercises into Clojure, which provides an excellent opportunity to:

- Learn fundamental DSP concepts (spectral decomposition, filtering, convolution, etc.)
- Practice implementing numerical algorithms in Clojure
- Explore Clojure libraries for audio processing and scientific computing
- Build a community resource of DSP examples in Clojure

The book author, Allen B. Downey, has generously provided [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP) that can serve as additional learning resources.

## Chat

We use the [#dsp](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/dsp) channel of the [Clojurians Zulip Chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/) (requires login). Please join the Zulip chat to participate in discussions and stay updated on meetings.

To be added to the calendar invitations, please write to us.

## Notes and Resources

Meeting notes will be published on the [Clojure Civitas](https://clojure.civitas.dev/) website.

Additional resources:
* [Think DSP book](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-dsp/) by Allen B. Downey
* [Think DSP GitHub repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP) with Jupyter notebooks
* [#dsp channel](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/dsp) on Clojurians Zulip

## Prerequisites

Basic Clojure knowledge is required to participate effectively in the study sessions. If you are new to Clojure but are curious to learn, let us talk -- we may help you catch up.

In recent months, the Clojure toolkit for data and science has been maturing. Thus, in 2025, Scicloj can finally shift more resources into making it accessible and well-known.

SciNoj Light is one of the first steps in that direction.

:calendar: [Event](https://clojureverse.org/t/scinoj-light-1st-conference/) (also available at the [Clojure Calendar Feed](../../events))

## What is it
SciNoj Light is an online conference where Clojurians will share their short-term data analysis stories.

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 mb-2" href="/docs/community/contact/" role="button">Any questions? Let us talk</a>

## Goals
* Encourage Clojurians to create small-but-complete usage stories of [Noj](https://scicloj.github.io/noj) and related libraries. Help them in the process.
* Focus on small stories and make it easy to contribute a topic.
* Explore our online conferencing practices in preparation for bigger "SciNoj" conferences where more established projects will be presented.
* Offer a [cynosure](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cynosure) for anybody who wishes to explore data with Clojure.

## Timeline
* Jan 20 - start discussing your initial ideas with the organizers
* Feb 15 - Call For Proposals opens
* Mar 15 - Call For Proposals closes - submit proposals (data analysis notebook drafts)
* Apr 1 - talks are selected
* May 10 - [prep workshop](https://scicloj.github.io/blog/data-analyis-with-clojure-free-workshop-may-10th-initial-survey/) for the curious
* May 16-17 - conference 
* TBD - a possible additional weekend with extra talks

## Chat
All communication in preparation and during the conference will take place at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/), specifically in the [#**scinoj-light-1**](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/479601-scinoj-light-1) channel.

## Participating
Participating is online and free.

## The SciNoj conference series
More SciNoj conferences are expected in the near future. Some of the future topics we are considering are (1) the uses of Clojure in teaching, (2) Clojure communities, and (3) Clojure in science.

## Join our Open Source Mentoring Program
Our [Open Source Mentoring program](../groups/open-source-mentoring) provides structured guidance for becoming a contributor to Scicloj open source projects.

## Participate in Dev and Study Groups
Scicloj hosts several [dev groups and study groups](../groups) that meet regularly to learn, brainstorm, and create together. Your unique perspective would be valuable.

## Share Your Experience
Your personal workflow, data stories, challenges, and ideas can benefit others in the community. Start a discussion in one of our [chat streams](../chat) to share your thoughts.

## Create a Tutorial
Writing tutorials (both small and large) about working with data is crucial for our community. This helps share real-world experiences and identifies areas for improvement in our stack. You can either translate existing tutorials to Clojure or create new ones with fresh datasets.

## Join the Organizing Team
If you're interested in community building or want to help shape our goals and priorities, consider joining the Scicloj organizing team. Even limited time contributions can make a significant impact.

## Collaborate with Library Authors
[Library](../../resources/libs) authors need users. Many actively developed libraries would benefit from user feedback and testing.

## Help Build the Website and Knowledge Base
The Scicloj website needs contributors for content organization, blog writing, and design improvements.

## Develop a Proof of Concept
If you see something missing in our stack, help create it! Start with a small proof of concept and test your idea with the community. You might find others interested in collaborating.

## Contribute to Libraries
Interested in learning about or helping build a specific [library](../../resources/libs)? Consider contributing through feature development, testing, or documentation. Many library authors welcome new contributors and can suggest good starting points.

## Submit Issues
Found a bug or missing feature? Maintainers of active [libraries](../../resources/libs) appreciate this feedback. Use the project's Issues page or Zulip stream - check the README for preferred communication channels.

Following Kira Howe's successful [workshop](https://bobkonf.de/2025/howe.html) at BobKonf 2025, we are planning a longer workshop for people who are curious to learn the Clojure language for data analysis.

The [SciNoj Light](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/scinoj-light/) conference schedule is emerging these days, with a fantastic set of talks. We want a broader audience to feel comfortable joining, and thus we wish to run a prep workshop one week earlier.

If you are interested, please share your preferences with us here:

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 mb-2" href="https://forms.gle/GR7HHz3id7aT2vYe7" role="button">Initial survey</a>

Based on the responses, we will decide whether to run the workshop, and how to design it.

## Tentative details
- Date: Saturday, May 10th
- A few hours long
- The content will be inspired by Kira Howe's workshop.
- We will assume some background in programming (say, at least 2 years with some programming language).
- We will not assume any background in Clojure or data analysis.

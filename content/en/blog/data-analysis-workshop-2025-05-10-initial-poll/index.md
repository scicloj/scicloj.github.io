(Update, 2025-05-03: The workshop is now :star: [announced](https://scicloj.github.io/scinoj-light-1/workshop.html) :star: .)

Following the maturing of the [Noj](https://scicloj.github.io/noj/) toolkit for Clojure data science, we are planning a free online workshop for people who are curious to learn the Clojure language for data analysis. Please share this page *broadly* with your friends and groups who may be curious to learn Clojure at this occasion.

The [SciNoj Light](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/scinoj-light/** conference schedule is emerging these days, with a fantastic set of talks. We want a broader audience to feel comfortable joining, and thus we wish to run a prep workshop one week earlier.

If you are interested in a workshop, please share your preferences with us here:

**(The Initial Survey is closed now.)**

Based on the responses, we will decide whether to run the workshop, and how to design it.

## Tentative details
- Date: Saturday, May 10th
- A few hours long
- We will start from scratch, including a beginner-friendly setup to run Clojure.
- We will assume some background in programming (say, at least 2 years with some programming language).
- We will **not** assume any background in Clojure or data analysis.
- The content will be inspired by Kira Howe's great [workshop](https://bobkonf.de/2025/howe.html) at the [BobKonf 2025](https://bobkonf.de/2025/en/) conference.

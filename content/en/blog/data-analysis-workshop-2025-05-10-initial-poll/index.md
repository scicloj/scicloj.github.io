Following the maturing of the [Noj](https://scicloj.github.io/noj/) toolkit for Clojure data science, we are planning a workshop for people who are curious to learn the Clojure language for data analysis.

Recently, Kira Howe gave a great [workshop](https://bobkonf.de/2025/howe.html) at the [BobKonf 2025](https://bobkonf.de/2025/en/) conference. Following that experience, we will now organize a longer workshop that will teach Clojure for data analysis from scratch.

The [SciNoj Light](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/scinoj-light/) conference schedule is emerging these days, with a fantastic set of talks. We want a broader audience to feel comfortable joining, and thus we wish to run a prep workshop one week earlier.

If you are interested, please share your preferences with us here:

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 mb-2" href="https://forms.gle/GR7HHz3id7aT2vYe7" role="button">Initial survey</a>

Based on the responses, we will decide whether to run the workshop, and how to design it.

Please share this page broadly with your friends and groups who may be curious to learn Clojure at this occasion.

## Tentative details
- Date: Saturday, May 10th
- A few hours long
- The content will be inspired by Kira Howe's workshop.
- We will assume some background in programming (say, at least 2 years with some programming language).
- We will not assume any background in Clojure or data analysis.
